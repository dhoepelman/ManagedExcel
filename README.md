# Managed Excel

This project is a .NET managed wrapper around the Excel COM objects, which aims to solve the various problems with COM in .NET.
This repository is a fork of [the dvsrc google code project](https://code.google.com/p/dvsrc/source/browse/trunk/CSharp/ManagedExcel), specifically [the ManagedExcel project](https://code.google.com/p/dvsrc/source/browse/trunk/CSharp/ManagedExcel).
That project was based on [the SafeCOMWrapper article](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/10888/SafeCOMWrapper-Managed-Disposable-Strongly-Typed-s).
It is recommended to read this article to know what the problems with COM in .NET are and how this project solves them.
